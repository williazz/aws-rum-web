# Optimize Performance

I need to optimize performance for a specific component or feature.

## Performance Issue

-   Component: [COMPONENT_NAME]
-   Issue: [high CPU|memory leak|slow startup|large bundle size|network overhead]
-   Metrics: [CURRENT_METRICS]
-   Target: [TARGET_METRICS]

## Context

[Describe the performance problem and where it occurs]

## Constraints

-   Must maintain backward compatibility: [yes|no]
-   Must work in browsers: [list minimum browser versions]
-   Bundle size budget: [SIZE_LIMIT]

## Analysis Needed

1. Profile the current implementation
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Propose optimization strategies
4. Implement changes
5. Verify performance improvement
6. Ensure no regressions in functionality

Please help me optimize this while maintaining code quality and test coverage.
