# Debug Test Failure

I have a failing test that needs debugging.

## Test Information

-   Test file: [PATH_TO_TEST]
-   Test type: [unit|integration|smoke]
-   Error message: [ERROR_MESSAGE]
-   Browser (if integration): [chrome|firefox|webkit|edge]

## Context

[Describe what the test is supposed to do and what's failing]

## Steps to Reproduce

```bash
# Command to run the failing test
[TEST_COMMAND]
```

Please help me:

1. Identify the root cause
2. Suggest a fix
3. Verify the fix doesn't break other tests

Note: For monkey-patching related tests, use Nightwatch instead of Playwright.
